# Our design

Our code is written in OCaml. We have implemented the core rules, a
scoring system, and a command line interface for the game. Our AI is
quite simple, with a few heuristic to compute moves.

# Running our code

We use:
- ocaml 4.02.1
- the packages ocamlfind, atdgen, bitv, ocurl, cmdliner
